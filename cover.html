        <p id="cover-p">Hello, I'm a senior at Hunter College majoring in Computer Science. My hobbies are studying and talking to friends. The reason I chose to major in computer Science is 
            that I find the problem solving portion to be very interesting and the fact that we can make programs using our coding knowledge to 
            make our lives easier. <br><br>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-wang-381a48201/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-wang-381a48201/</a> <br>
